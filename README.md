# Velveta Bot – Feature Overview

Velveta is a powerful multi-functional Discord bot designed to enhance server management, security, and engagement. Below is a breakdown of Velveta's core systems and functionalities:

---

## 1. Global Security & Verification System 🔐
- Upon joining, users are directed to a secure verification portal and restricted from viewing server channels until verified.
- Once verified, users receive a **Global Passport** and a synced role across all servers using Velveta's system.
- Velveta enforces **Global Bans**, issued solely by its security team after reviewing admin-submitted reports. Users may appeal by DMing: `I want to appeal my global ban`.
- The **portal server** is used exclusively for verification and appeals.
- Users can view their global passport using: `=passport [user]` or `/passport`.
- The system functions independently of any individual server and relies solely on Velveta’s partner network.

## 2. Global Chat 🌐
- Enables cross-server communication between members in designated channels.
- Monitored by Velveta with built-in filters: anti-spam, anti-link, anti-phishing, and anti-advertisement.
- Secure and seamless message relay between approved channels.
